Pathing

This repository can be used to construct MotionPaths for autonomous movement of robots. You can make any path that has defined linear derivatives (in other words, you can go as deep or as shallow as you want, as long as you end with a line of some sort).

To visualize results, you can download JMathIO and JMathPlot for Java graphs.
Found here:
https://github.com/yannrichet/jmathio/blob/master/dist/jmathio.jar
https://github.com/yannrichet/jmathplot

TO INSTALL PROPERLY, USE THE JMATHIO.JAR, DOWNLOAD OR CLONE THE REPOSITORY OF JMATHPLOT, THEN REPLACE THE jmathplot.jar FILE WITH THIS .JAR FILE:
http://www.mediafire.com/file/wa3g3jfs6hv6aif/jmathplot.jar

OR you can download Anaconda and visualize results using the dispCsv.py script which is part of the repository.

OR you can see some example resultant images in the examples folder.
